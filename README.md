# Incentive policies to reduce Carbon emissions


Carbon emission is amongst one of the most serious issues of our time. One of the main contributors for this externality is the Industry. In this project, we investigate using a rather simple model the efficiency of an incentive policy between a state and one representative of the companies. This falls under a Principal-Agent problem, with three parameters being the action taken by the company, the penalty imposed by the government and the salary given by the latter, with both the penalty and the salaries being incentives.
The characteristic of this problem is that the action taken is not observable, which puts us in the moral hazard context. 
This approach also takes the form of a Stackelberg game because the contract is optimized in two steps: first we find the action taken by the company, then the government applies penalties accordingly. 
The goal of this project is to derive numerically or analytically the optimal action of the agent and evaluate the impact of the incentive policy with respect to this optimal action. 
After testing and comparing the results, we concluded that in most cases, the companies can be incited to take considerable actions,
yet the choice of the optimal contract needs to be discussed according to the needs and constraints of each party.
